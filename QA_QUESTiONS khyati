command to create container from the image?
If you want to run a container in the background using -d, then what is the need of the -it flags.???
         Some programs inside the container require a TTY (terminal) to run properly.
         If you’re just running a service (like a web server) in the background, you only need:docker run -d <image>
how to get inside container?
          docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash
          Alternative: Using docker attach(docker attach connects you to the container’s main process (the one started by the original docker run command).

If you get an OCI runtime error when running???
          Some containers (especially minimal ones like Alpine) don’t have /bin/bash,Try using /bin/sh instead
docker exec <container_id_or_name> /bin/sh
            without -it, Docker will execute the shell, but:
            You won’t have an interactive terminal.
            The shell will start, but since you’re not attached interactively, you won’t see a prompt or be able to type commands.
            The command will just run and immediately exit, so it’s usually not useful for interactive access.
